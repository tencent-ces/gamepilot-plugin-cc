## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Streamed ACP output and thought chunks** ([#20], closes [#15]). `runAcpPrompt` now distinguishes `agent_thought_chunk` from `agent_message_chunk` end-to-end, accumulates a separate `thoughtText` return field, and records a dedicated `model_thought_chunk` event (char counts only — raw prose is never persisted).
- **`--stream-output` flag** for `/gamepilot:rescue` and `/gamepilot:review` ([#20]). Live stderr forwarding of model chunks and thoughts (with a `thought:` prefix). Default mode shows compact progress markers (`[session]`, `[tool]`, `.` per chunk, `[thinking]`, `[file]`, `[done] stats`). EPIPE-safe; auto-suppressed in `--json` mode unless explicitly opted in.
- **`--thinking <off|low|medium|high>` flag** ([#20]). T-shirt-sized reasoning budgets that resolve per model family (GamePilot 3 / 3.1 `thinkingLevel`; GamePilot 2.5 `thinkingBudget` with off→low clamping). Replaces the non-functional `--thinking-budget <n>`. Emits a one-shot stderr warning noting that upstream GamePilot CLI 0.38.x delivers thinking via persistent `settings.json`, not per-invocation.
- **GamePilot job observability** ([#16], closes [#14]). New `lib/job-observability.mjs` helper with bounded event log (50 events/job, 500-char diagnostic cap, ANSI/CSI/OSC/DCS stripping). Derived health fields expose liveness, progress, rate-limit, auth-block, broker, and worker states.
- **`/gamepilot:status` event tail** ([#16], [#20]). `renderSingleJobStatus` shows the last 5 sanitized events with human-readable `Ns ago` timestamps, rollup counters (`chunks/thoughts/tools/files`), and graceful fallback when the event log is absent.
- **Broker trust boundary** ([#16]). Distinct `broker/diagnostic` JSON-RPC method prevents compromised children from forging broker notifications.
- **CI test workflow** ([#9]). `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `npm test` on every PR. PR cleanup workflow added.
- **Docs-agreement test suite** ([#20]). `tests/docs-agreement.test.mjs` asserts `--thinking` and `--stream-output` stay documented across `README.md`, `rescue.md`, and `review.md`, and that the stale `--thinking-budget <number>` form is gone.

### Changed
- **Model selection guidance** ([#8], closes [#7]). Updated `/gamepilot:rescue` and `/gamepilot:review` guidance to pass explicit Studio-configured model names with `--model <model-id>`.
- **ACP protocol type definitions** ([#20]). `lib/acp-protocol.d.ts` replaces the stale `AcpNotification` union (`progress`/`toolCall`/`fileChange`/`error` — none matched the real runtime) with `SessionUpdateNotification` modeling `agent_message_chunk`, `agent_thought_chunk`, `tool_call`, `file_change`, plus `broker/diagnostic`.
- **Documentation**. `README.md` adds a "Live Progress & Thinking Levels" section; `plugins/gamepilot/commands/rescue.md`, `plugins/gamepilot/commands/review.md`, and `plugins/gamepilot/agents/gamepilot-rescue.md` refreshed with new `argument-hint` and runtime-flag lists.

### Fixed
- **Root workspace path containment** ([#13], closes [#6]). Path containment check no longer false-negatives at filesystem root (`/`).
- **ACP broker socket permissions (TOCTOU)** ([#12], closes [#5]). Socket permissions now set atomically to eliminate the time-of-check-to-time-of-use race.
- **ACP protocol type map** ([#10], closes [#3]). Aligned the type definitions with the runtime method name that was actually being dispatched.
- **`--scope` flag validation** ([#9], closes [#2]). Invalid values now fail fast with a clear error instead of silently falling back to `working-tree`.
- **PID-reuse false positives** ([#16]). `defaultIsProcessAlive` now treats `EPERM` as a dead worker to avoid reading a stranger process as alive after a PID is recycled.

### Removed
- **Dead code in `stop-review-gate-hook`** ([#11], closes [#4]). Unused imports and branches pruned.
- **`--thinking-budget <number>` flag** ([#20]). Replaced by `--thinking <off|low|medium|high>`; the numeric form was non-functional.

### Security
- **Broker passthrough forgery (HIGH)** ([#16]). Broker no longer forwards arbitrary child notifications as broker-origin diagnostics.
- **Diagnostic sanitization** ([#16]). All broker and worker diagnostics strip ANSI/CSI/OSC/DCS sequences and enforce a 500-char cap before entering the event log or the compact job index.
- **Privacy-preserving observability** ([#16], [#20]). Compact job-index and progress events use an explicit allow-list. Raw prompts, raw model prose, and raw thought prose never enter job files, status output, or logs — only char counts.
