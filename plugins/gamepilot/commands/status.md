If the user did not pass a job ID:
- Render the command output as a single Markdown table for the current and past runs in this session.
- Keep it compact. Do not include progress blocks or extra prose outside the table.
- Preserve the actionable fields from the command output, including job ID, kind, status, phase, Health, Last Progress, elapsed or duration, summary, and follow-up commands.

If the user did pass a job ID:
- Present the full command output to the user.
- Do not summarize or condense it.
- Preserve health status, health message, recommended action, runtime transport, session ID, last heartbeat/progress/model-output/tool-call/diagnostic timestamps, and the Recent Events section. Do not drop any of these fields.
