Run:

!`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gamepilot-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"`

Output rules:
- Present the review output to the user exactly as returned.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add your own commentary.
- Do not make any code changes based on the review findings.
- CRITICAL: After presenting review findings, STOP. Do not fix any issues. Ask the user which issues, if any, they want addressed before touching a single file.
